The water cycle is a process where water moves between oceans, the atmosphere, and land. It has steps like evaporation, condensation, precipitation, and collection. In evaporation, water turns into vapor and rises because of heat from the sun. Then, it condenses into clouds in the atmosphere. When clouds get heavy, water falls as precipitation, like rain or snow, and collects in rivers, lakes, or oceans.
